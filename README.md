## Welcome to my Twitter Classifier

This code collects the *n* most recent tweets for a specific Twitter hashtag during a specific period and then predicts the thematic area for each tweet using the Stochastic Gradient Descent classification model. 

To use this code, download the 'Twitter_Scraper_GitHub.ipynb' file above and run it on Jupyter Notebook. Use the 'Twitter_TrainingSet_SAMPLE' file as a training data set (please note this is a sample training data set for the purpose of demonstrating the code).
